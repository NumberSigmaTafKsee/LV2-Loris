# LV2-Loris
Additive Analyzer/Synthesizer

# It is sort of like a vocoder
* It also has an addiive synthesizer
* The synthesizer can morph sounds

# So it is useful
* analyzer
* synthesizer
* cross-synthesizer

# It is used in MIDGET
* Real-Time Voice Cloning for the Modern Industrial Design

# It can be used as a morphing speech synthesizer
* You can use the analyzer
* You can synthesize it with World

# I combine it with the formant resontor theory
* When combined with Real Sound Synthesis you have a complete vocoder speech decoder
* Now, you need resonant bandpass filter - no problem
* You can use World with it
* You can use SPTK to get all kinds of speech dsp algorithms like the filters 
* Now with the formant filters and the lpc you can make it synthesize the speech or morph it to sound like darth vader
